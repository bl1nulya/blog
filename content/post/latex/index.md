# LaTeX

LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is available as free software.

LaTeX is not a word processor! Instead, LaTeX encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents but to concentrate on getting the right content.

# LaTeX Features
  * Typesetting journal articles, technical reports, books, and slide presentations.
  * Control over large documents containing sectioning, cross-references, tables and figures.
  * Typesetting of complex mathematical formulas.
  * Advanced typesetting of mathematics with AMS-LaTeX.
  * Automatic generation of bibliographies and indexes.
  * Multi-lingual typesetting.
  * Inclusion of artwork, and process or spot colour.
  * Using PostScript or Metafont fonts.
